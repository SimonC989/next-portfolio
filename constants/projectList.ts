    description:
      'Nerv Comms is a communications web app being built for dental practices to be an all-inclusive package. Most medical practices are underserved by modern technology, where they would need to manage multiple software services to fill their needs. We\'re trying to solve that problem by creating a single app that allows calling and texting patients, scheduling, and automated reminders. This is being developed to solve the frustration that my best friend sees in his brother in laws practice where not only are they dealing with multiple tools from different companies, but those tools aren’t even tailored to his use case. The team currently consists of me creating the frontend, while my best friend manages the backend.\n This is where I spend most of my time besides the occasional side project that catches my attention. I prefer to make a complete application than project types since it feels like it would replicate a production service more. It also leads to discovering more new and interesting problems that come from complications implementing multiple features and how they collide sometimes. Smaller projects felt like it is mostly made to discover a few hurdles you might face but I don’t like how most of the time spent was towards just rendering components, simple CSS, and setting up a new project.',

This is the first project made outside of smaller components since coming back to coding and learning hooks since React moved away from class components. Probably won’t use Syncfusion again since the library size is so huge and would be better off using smaller individual component libraries.',

      'The similar homes module from Abode.ly was scaled and deployed through AWS EC2 instances to meet web-scale demand. An RDBMS(PostgreSQL) and a NoSQL DBMS(Apache Cassandra) were compared for optimal query speeds and their abilities to bulk load data in a timely manner. PostgreSQL was decided because a complex query was required and time constraints. Cassandra is known to be quick for reads but setting up clusters that allow for a complex query for more than two columns would take a significant amount of time. NGINX was used for load balancing and a simple Redis implementation was done to further improve throughput and response time by caching the most recent queries.',
