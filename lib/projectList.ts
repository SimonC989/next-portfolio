    description:
      'Nerv Comms is a communications web app being built for dental practices to be an all-inclusive package. Most medical practices are underserved by modern technology, where they would need to manage multiple software services to fill their needs. We\'re trying to solve that problem by creating a single app that allows calling and texting patients, scheduling, and automated reminders. This is being developed to solve the frustration that my best friend sees in his brother in laws practice where not only are they dealing with multiple tools from different companies, but those tools arenâ€™t even tailored to his use case. The team currently consists of me creating the front end, while my best friend manages the backend.\n This is where I spend most of my time beside the occasional side project that catches my attention. I prefer to do a complete application then project types since it feels like it would replicate a production service more. It also leads to discovering more new and interesting problems that come from complications implimenting multiple features and how they collide sometimes. Smaller projects felt like its mostly made to discover a few hurdles you might face but I felt most of the time spent was towards rendering components and CSS.',
